# UI5 Linter Fix Plan

Turn UI5 Linter findings into an ordered remediation plan. Do not edit unless the user explicitly chooses an apply mode.

## Workflow

1. Parse linter findings or run a read-only linter check if findings are not supplied.
2. Group issues into mechanical fixes, API migrations, behavior-sensitive changes, and manual review items.
3. Prioritize security and broken behavior before style or modernization.
4. For apply mode, only edit low-risk mechanical fixes after naming the exact files.
5. Provide verification commands after each batch.

## Output Contract

Return:
- Fix batches with risk level.
- Files and rules affected.
- Proposed code changes or applied edits.
- Commands to re-run lint/build/tests.
- Items that require manual UI/runtime validation.
