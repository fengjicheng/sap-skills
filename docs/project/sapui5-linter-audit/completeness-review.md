## ⚠️ PARTIALLY COVERED (Enhancements Available)

### 1. Contributing Guidelines (60% coverage)

**What We Have**:
- Development.md and Guidelines.md cover coding standards, testing, git workflow

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Issue reporting requirements and templates
- ❌ Bug report standards
- ❌ Feature request process
- ❌ Issue labels (detection, autofix, documentation, etc.)
- ❌ Task Board reference
- ❌ Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
- ❌ Security issue reporting process
- ❌ AI-generated code guidelines

**Enhancement Action**: Create `references/contributing.md`

---

### 2. Support Channels (50% coverage)

**What We Have**:
- General troubleshooting in SKILL.md
- Links to official repository

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ StackOverflow tag (ui5-tooling)
- ❌ OpenUI5 Slack channel (#tooling)
- ❌ Community support guidelines
- ❌ When to use GitHub issues vs community channels

**Enhancement Action**: Add to `references/support-and-community.md`

---

### 3. CI/CD Examples (70% coverage)

**What We Have**:
- Basic GitHub Actions template
- Pre-commit hook template

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Real-world CI workflow from UI5 Linter project itself
- ❌ Multi-job CI examples
- ❌ Coverage reporting integration
- ❌ License checking integration
- ❌ Dependency checking (depcheck)

**Enhancement Action**: Enhance `templates/github-actions-lint.yml` and create `references/advanced-ci-cd.md`

---

## ❌ NOT COVERED (Low Priority)

### Internal Project Files

**Justification for Exclusion**:
- Configuration files (eslint.config.js, tsconfig.json, ava.config.js) - Internal to UI5 Linter development
- Test runner configs - Not relevant to skill users
- Build scripts - Not relevant to skill users
- Security policy - Referenced in CONTRIBUTING, not needed in detail
- RFCs - Only template exists, no active RFCs to document

### Test Fixtures

**Status**: Not extracted

**Reasoning**:
- Test fixtures are primarily for UI5 Linter development/testing
- Our templates provide cleaner, production-ready examples
- Fixtures may contain edge cases not relevant to typical users
- Maintaining fixture references would require frequent updates

**Alternative**: Our templates serve this purpose better

---

## Enhancement Plan

### High Priority Enhancements

#### 1. Create `references/contributing.md`
**Content**:
- Issue reporting guidelines
- Bug report requirements
- Feature request process
- Issue labels and their meanings
- Developer Certificate of Origin
- Security issue reporting
- Contribution workflow

**Estimated Size**: ~2,000 words

**Value**: Helps users contribute back to UI5 Linter project

---

#### 2. Create `references/support-and-community.md`
**Content**:
- StackOverflow (ui5-tooling tag)
- OpenUI5 Slack (#tooling channel)
- When to use each channel
- Community guidelines
- Getting help vs reporting bugs

**Estimated Size**: ~1,000 words

**Value**: Helps users get help efficiently

---

#### 3. Enhance `references/advanced-ci-cd.md`
**Content**:
- UI5 Linter's own CI workflow
- Coverage reporting (Coveralls)
- License checking
- Dependency checking
- Multi-job workflows
- Advanced automation patterns

**Estimated Size**: ~2,500 words

**Value**: Real-world CI/CD examples beyond basics

---

### Medium Priority Enhancements

#### 4. Add Example Project Structures
**Content**:
- Typical UI5 application structure with linter
- UI5 library structure with linter
- Monorepo setup

**Proposed location**: Add a project-structure reference if this enhancement is implemented.

**Estimated Size**: ~1,500 words

**Value**: Helps users understand how linter fits into projects

---

### Low Priority (Optional)

#### 5. Test Fixture Examples
**Status**: Not recommended

**Reasoning**: Our templates are better suited for users than test fixtures

---
